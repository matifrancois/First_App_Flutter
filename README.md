# First_app
This is my first flutter application, it is a really simple app that allows you to answer three questions (but can easily be expanded to more). Based on your answers the program tells you what kind of person you are: a normal, strange, or very strange person.


## Getting Started

Make sure you have an emulator or a USB-connected device with debugging mode enabled to run the application there. You also need to have Flutter installed.

#### 1. [Set up Flutter](https://flutter.io/setup/)

#### 2. Clone the repo

In the Command Prompt (CMD):

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/matifrancois/First_App_Flutter
$ cd First_App_Flutter
```

#### 4. Run the app

```sh
$ flutter run
```
